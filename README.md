# Music Releases on Spotify
This is a project that fetches "New music releases" with an old Spotify API (2019). 
The project showcases new albums and singles and leads to spotify by clicking the "play button". 

## The problem
The app is built with JavaScript and various React components that are styled with CSS. 

The aim was to: 
✓ Understand the role of node & npm for running JavaScript scripts
✓ What problems React solves.
✓ What a boilerplate project is, and how to run the Technigo react starter project.
✓ How to break up JavaScript code into importable modules.
✓ How to write JSX and React components
✓ How to use `.map` to iterate over an array of data and mount many components
✓ How to use React props to feed information to components
✓ How to structure React projects into small chunks

Tech used, 
- React 
- JavaScript
- Node.js 
- CSS 

I there were more time, additional sections would be added as well as seperating singles from albums, 
and maybe render popular playlists (or even use a fresher API?)
